I'm excited to share a case study of my latest project: **NOCIS (National Sports Career Information System)**.

This project was built to address real-world challenges in the sports industry recruitment process, such as the fragmentation of career opportunities and the difficulty organizers face in sourcing qualified staff efficiently. The solution focuses on centralizing sports career opportunities and streamlining the hiring workflow.

✨ **Key Features:**
✅ **Smart Job Discovery:** Specialized filtering system allowing professionals to easily find opportunities based on specific sports categories.
✅ **Seamless Application Flow:** details-oriented application system with distinct workflows for "One-Click Apply" and status tracking.
✅ **Dynamic Professional Profiles:** Comprehensive user profiles integrating CV uploads, social media links, and portfolio showcases.
✅ **Admin Analytics Dashboard:** rigorous real-time reporting on platform activity, applicant statistics, and event management.

🛠 **Tech Stack:**
Laravel 12
Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
Axios
Tailwind CSS v4 & PostCSS
Vite

Blade Templates

This case study demonstrates how digital transformation can bridge the gap between sports professionals and recruiters, ensuring fair and efficient access to opportunities.

Open to discussion or feedback on building systems with Laravel and Modern PHP!
